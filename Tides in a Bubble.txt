Tides in a Bubble
A glass bubble containing a frozen exerpt of the Tides.
When placed next to one's ear, it faintly emits
the sounds of the ocean. The craft of producing
such curios dates back to the ancient Tidal Dynasty.
Said to draw from Nature's own potentia,
this trinket possesses a unique ability to
return matter — sometimes even time — back to its
most unsophisticated state.
