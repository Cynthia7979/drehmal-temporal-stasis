Embered Crown

A burning golden crown wrought by royal smiths
in the reign of Maelihs, bestowed only upon the most
devoted and bloodthirsty Maelmari warriors. Writhing glyphs
are inscribed where the metal glows ember-bright,
imbuing the bearer with chaotic strength,
yet cursing them to rue their ambition through life-long anguish.
